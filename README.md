# Python Cryptocurrency Bot 

In this project I would like to make progress in connecting to API and acquiring data in real time.

## To Do List
1. Rewrite project uder rules of my new project template (this hopefully will ease process of creating future software and will help in troubleshooting).
2. Rewrite analysis part for using *numpy* library instead of built-in python lists.
3. Add communication with program (requires *asyncio* and *websocet**s*** library instead of *websocket*): 
    1. Add .json file with initialization settings.  
    2. Add CLI.
    3. Add GUI.
4. Add option for connecting and testing analysis part of software without makeing real world transactions.
5. Rewrite analysis part of software for connecting with CUDA framework.
6. Coming soon ðŸ˜œ.
